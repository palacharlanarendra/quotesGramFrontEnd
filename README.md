<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

QuotesGram, where you can post your favourite quotes, following are the features, I tried to mimic few features from Twitter/FB.
Here's are the features:
* User Authentication using JWT.  
* Displaying the global quotes for the website visitor.  
* Website visitors can read all the quotes posted by the users.    
* Authorized users can only post new quotes. 
* Authorized users can only like, dislike, and give heart to any of the quotes.  
* Logged in user can edit his settings, can view his own profile.  



A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.
